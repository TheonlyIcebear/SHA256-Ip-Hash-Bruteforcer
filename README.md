# SHA256-Ip-Hash-Bruteorcer 👩‍💻
A python program that will bruteforce a sha256 encoded Ip address

# Usage ⚙
 - Just enter the hashed ip address inside the `self.target` variable <br>
 - Then enter the amount of threads inside the `self.threads` variable (Program may become unstable with more threads, esspecially if you add over 255 threads)

# Note 📝
Will take anywhere a few minutes to hours to decode but that's because there's 4.2 billion possible ip addresses that the program has to check a lot of them depending on how high up the target's ip is
